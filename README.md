# Data Wrangling and Visualization in Python

## Overview

This project is part of the **ECE 2112: Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms** course at the **University of Santo Tomas**. The goal of the project is to perform **data wrangling** and **data visualization** using the provided **ECE Board Exam dataset**. The analysis is carried out using Python and the following libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains student records from **ECE Board Exams**. You can download the dataset from the provided link: [ECE Board Exam Dataset](bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset).

The dataset includes the following features:
- `Name`: The name of the student
- `Gender`: Gender of the student
- `Track`: The academic track chosen by the student (e.g., Instrumentation, Communication)
- `Math`, `GEAS`, `Electronics`: Scores in respective subjects
- `Hometown`: Region of origin (e.g., Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao)

## Intended Learning Outcomes

1. Understand how to use Python libraries for data wrangling (i.e., `pandas`) and data visualization (i.e., `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2. Learn to clean, manipulate, and transform datasets into useful information.
3. Create visual representations that tell a story about the dataset.
